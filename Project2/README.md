# Project 2: VANET Abstraction

## How to run the code
  File provided: "VANETDATA.txt"
  
    In order for this program to run the file being read must be named this and due to the use of scanner class 
    in the code and the way it was implemented it will be best to ensure it stays in its form (DO NOT EDIT)
    
 The following files were provided and should not be edited
 
   * Vanet.java
   * Driver.java
   * AbstractDateTime.java
   * AbstractVANET
   * AbstractVehicle
   * Sample Output.txt
   * VANETdata.txt
    
  Create the following classes

  * InheritDateTime: takes givem month and year and defines the day that the first and last day of the month would start with
  * InheritVANET: Defines and overrides AbstractVANET to identify where the check is being sent to/from and the value
  * InheritVehicle: extends AbstractVehicle calculates the values of floor ceiling and average of the chars in the file
  * LetterAvg: takes the value of the letter that was found to be the average based off an ascii table and the average value of chars in the file
  * PosAvg: defines the index of vehicle and the strings in the indexes surrounding i.e. the average of 20 is 19 & 21, and 18 & 22
